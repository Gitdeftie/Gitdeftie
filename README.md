- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gitdeftie
- 👀 I’m interested in AI and automation so I can work multiple rudimentary jobs at the same time (advising my employers of course..)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, JS and node/next.js using AI assistance to answer my questions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything if i get reached out to. I cannot imagine as I do not know how to seriously code anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: Anyway you want it, thats the way you need it.
